# main module: 
  Responsible for URL rewriting  The rewriter intercepts URLs and rewrites the URL.  The rewriter is used to invoke the controller, run tests, and simulate the REST web service.  In most cases it delegates to the controller (/controller.xqy).  For example, given the original URL in the browser:  http://host:port/search?term=science&amp;from=1&amp;to=12  The URL rewriter would rewrite and pass the url to the server as:  http://host:port/app/controller.xqy?action=search&amp;term=science&amp;from=1&amp;to=12  return $request-url A url ready for server resolution.
